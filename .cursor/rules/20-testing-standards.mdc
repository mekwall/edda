# Testing Requirements

All Rust CLI code must be tested before commit. This applies to command modules, data processing, and CLI interfaces.

---

## âœ… Requirements

- Every commit must pass:

  - `cargo test`
  - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
  - `cargo fmt --check`

- New features must be accompanied by:

  - Unit tests for individual functions and modules
  - Integration tests for complete command workflows
  - Tests should cover both happy path and error cases

- CLI interfaces must include:

  - Command-line argument parsing tests
  - Output format validation tests
  - Error handling tests for invalid inputs
  - Integration tests with real file system operations

- Test names must:

  - Clearly describe the expected behavior
  - Include input cases and relevant edge conditions
  - Follow the pattern: `test_<function_name>_<scenario>`

- Rust testing patterns:

  - Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for unit tests
  - Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests
  - Mock external dependencies using `mockall` or similar
  - Use `assert_cmd` for CLI testing
  - Use `tempfile` for temporary file testing

- CLI testing patterns:
  - Use `assert_cmd::Command` for command execution tests
  - Test output formats (text, JSON, YAML)
  - Test error conditions and exit codes
  - Test with different input scenarios
