- Installation scripts
- CI/CD pipeline
- Container deployment
- Cloud deployment
- Monitoring and observability
- Security and compliance

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Required for production deployment

## Task ID System

Each task has a unique ID following this pattern:

- **TASK-XXX**: Main task categories (e.g., TASK-001 for MVP task management)
- **TASK-XXX-XXX**: Subtask categories (e.g., TASK-001-001 for core data model)
- **TASK-XXX-XXX-XXX**: Individual tasks (e.g., TASK-001-001-001 for Task struct definition)

## Milestone Tracking

Each document includes:

- **MILESTONE-XXX**: Major achievement milestones
- **Quality Gates**: Specific criteria that must be met
- **Success Criteria**: Clear definitions of completion

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Start with MVP Phase 0**: Focus on `00-mvp-phase-0.md` first
2. **Check off completed tasks**: Use `[x]` to mark completed items
3. **Add new tasks**: When new requirements are identified, add them with appropriate IDs
4. **Update progress**: Regularly update task status and add notes for blockers

### For Project Management

1. **Track progress**: Monitor completion of tasks and milestones
2. **Identify blockers**: Note any tasks that are blocked or need clarification
3. **Prioritize work**: Use the priority levels to guide development focus
4. **Update estimates**: Adjust timelines based on actual progress

### For Documentation

1. **Keep tasks current**: Update task descriptions as requirements evolve
2. **Add context**: Include relevant specification references
3. **Document decisions**: Add notes about implementation choices
4. **Link to code**: Reference specific files or commits when relevant

## Task Status Tracking

### Status Indicators

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[!]` - Blocked
- `[?]` - Needs clarification

### Progress Notes

Add notes after tasks to track:

- Implementation details
- Blockers or dependencies
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Testing requirements

## Integration with Specifications

These TODO documents are directly derived from the specifications in `.cursor/spec/`:

- **SPEC_OVERVIEW.md**: Overall project goals and technology stack
- **SPEC_ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture and component design
- **SPEC_CLI_DESIGN.md**: Command-line interface specifications
- **SPEC_TASK_MANAGEMENT.md**: Task management system requirements
- **SPEC_SYNC_ENGINE.md**: Sync provider architecture
- **SPEC_AI_INTEGRATION.md**: AI agent integration requirements
- **SPEC_DEPLOYMENT.md**: Deployment and distribution requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Before Marking Tasks Complete

1. **Code review**: Ensure code follows project standards
2. **Testing**: Verify functionality works as expected
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with other components
5. **Performance**: Validate performance requirements are met

### Regular Reviews

- **Weekly**: Review progress and identify blockers
- **Monthly**: Assess milestone progress and adjust priorities
- **Quarterly**: Evaluate overall project health and timeline

## Notes

- All tasks should align with the project specifications
- Priority levels should guide development focus
- Regular updates keep the TODO documents current and useful
- Blockers should be identified and resolved promptly
- Success criteria should be measurable and achievable
